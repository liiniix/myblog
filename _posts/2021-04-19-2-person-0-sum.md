In game, each player make decision at the same time.

If player R choose before player C, R is guaranteed a payoff of at least at least $$max_{s_1\in S_1} min_{s_2\in S_2} f(s_1, s_2)$$

If player C choose before player R, C can guarntee that R reciences at most $$min_{s_2\in S_2} max_{s_1\in S_1} f(s_1, s_2)$$

So following property holds,
    $$max_{s_1\in S_1} min_{s_2\in S_2} f(s_1, s_2) \le  min_{s_2\in S_2} max_{s_1\in S_1} f(s_1, s_2)$$
